# KVMi subsystem for KVM

This page tracks the new versions of the `KVMi` subsystem for KVM.

## Description

The KVM introspection subsystem provides a facility for applications
running on the host or in a separate VM, to control the execution of
other VMs (pause, resume, shutdown), query the state of the vCPUs (GPRs,
MSRs etc.), alter the page access bits in the shadow page tables (only
for the hardware backed ones, eg. Intel's EPT) and receive notifications
when events of interest have taken place (shadow page table level faults,
key MSR writes, hypercalls etc.). Some notifications can be responded
to with an action (like preventing an MSR from being written), others
are mere informative (like breakpoint events which can be used for
execution tracing).  With few exceptions, all events are optional. An
application using this subsystem will explicitly register for them.

The use case that gave way for the creation of this subsystem is to
monitor the guest OS and as such the ABI/API is highly influenced by how
the guest software (kernel, applications) sees the world. For example,
some events provide information specific for the host CPU architecture
(eg. `MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_EIP`) merely because its leveraged by guest software
to implement a critical feature (fast system calls).

At the moment, the target audience for KVMI are security software authors
that wish to perform forensics on newly discovered threats (exploits)
or to implement another layer of security like preventing a large set
of kernel rootkits simply by "locking" the kernel image in the shadow
page tables (ie. enforce `.text` `r-x`, `.rodata` `rw-` etc.). It's the latter
case that made KVMI a separate subsystem, even though many of these
features are available in the device manager. The ability to build a
security application that does not interfere (in terms of performance)
with the guest software asks for a specialized interface that is designed
for minimum overhead.
